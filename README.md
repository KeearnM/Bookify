# Bookify

A book app that recommends me books based on a list of genres I have selected. The app also allows me to either add books from the recommended section into a reading list or directly search books that the user wants to be added into a reading list

## Getting started

Trello board:

The features I have envisioned when planning the app was the following:

### Search

I wanted a search feature that sends a simple query to Google books API and return a set number 

### Reading List

I want a reading list that is displayed that shows what are the newest books the users have added

### Recommended Books

A set of recommended books that is returned from Google API that is based on a genre list that the user can edit


## Future Enhancement

I want another set of recommended books that is based on the current user reading list 

I want to store categories of the books the user has in the reading list and based on the categories return a set of recommended books from Google Books
